# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is strongly advised to ensure that you have the latest version 
of the project before commencing coding. Kindly pull/fetch for new
changes that may have been made by your team members.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

As a user, you bear full responsibility for any unauthorized access 
to the files. It is imperative that you promptly report any vulnerabilities 
that you discover to prevent potential misconduct that could lead to project failure. 
In the event of such misconduct, a zero will be assigned to our project, as well as 
other consequences, including but not limited to, disciplinary action for individuals 
found guilty of violating project policies.
